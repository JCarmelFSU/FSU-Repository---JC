Game Title: Cube Onslaught

You play as a Cube Cannon, a remarkable self-defense turret, against the slow encroach of flying cube soldiers who return fire on our spry piece of artillery.

Use A and D to move left and right, and press the spacebar to jump. Press the E key to fire a bullet.

Jump around and shoot the cubes until they get past you or destroy you with a shot.

Features:
- Jumping player
- Constant enemies in random spawns which fire back at the player

All assets made in Unity using basic polygons.
